# How does LinkedIn algorithm works

LinkedIn's priority is (CIPS):

* _**C**_**onnect**
* _**I**_**nteract**
* _**P**_**ositionate**
* _**S**_**calate**

To make the professional profile visible (in CIPS cycle), LinkedIn evaluates 3 key factors:

* **interaction type**. How we connect or interact (comments, emoticons, etc.)
* **interaction time**. Display time (to read publications, posts, etc.)
* **segmentation**. If we get to the right audience

Algorithm evaluation method for the **company** profile:

* **number of followers**
* **type of content**
* **interaction**

Algorithm evaluation method for the **professional** profile:

* **our network interaction with us**
  * **number of contacts**
  * **reactions**
  * **interaction**
* **how do we publish our content**
  * **content type**
  * **time zone**. Best time to post
* **followers**

How the algorithm is expanded

* **professional profile**. More interactions = more speed
* **company profile**. Low profile, LinkedIn understands that who move business are people. The company publishes in relation to its business niche and not all relationships are pending. It's very difficult to position because the expansion speed is minimal

Scale of the spread of each post:

* **exposure to 10% of our contacts**. If the answer is positive, go to the next phase
* **exposure to 100% of our contacts**. If the answer is positive, go to the next phase
* **exposure to the entire network (organic viralization)**. This is the desired point

**Post speed** (per minute): Full views (after 1 hour of posting) / 60
