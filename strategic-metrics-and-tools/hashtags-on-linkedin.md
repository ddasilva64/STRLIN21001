# Hashtags on LinkedIn

Hashtags are linked keywords without spaces, preceded by the # symbol (hashtag), that we add to our writing on LinkedIn and that make it easy to be located by third parties (visibility).

You always have to see the number of followers that a hashtag (#) has, we will try to make that number as high as possible, in this way we ensure maximum visibility.

A very good tool to handle this data (number of followers of hashtags created on LinkedIn) is **Airtable** (see link below).

**What is Airtable, and what is it for?**

Airtable is a very easy-to-use collaborative cloud tool, with the appearance of a spreadsheet but with the functionality of a database

The fields of an Airtable table are similar to the cells of a spreadsheet, but have functionalities such as drop-down lists, checkboxes, phone numbers, can be related to other fields in the table or database, and can refer to attachments such as images or PDF documents

With Airtable, users can create a database tailored to their needs, configure different types of columns, add records, link tables together, collaborate with other people, filter or classify records, and publish views on external websites or applications

It is also a perfectly integrable system with more than 2,000 applications (email, calendars, newsletter, content manager, ERP, social networks, etc.), thanks to platforms such as Zapier or Integromat

**Who is using it?**

The application has been gaining popularity in recent years in organizations of all types and sizes

In 2018 the company raised an investment of $ 100M and the system is already used by more than 170,000 companies. Multinationals, SMEs, freelancers, and even individuals use it to manage their day-to-day. Well-known companies already use Airtable to optimize resources, save time and promote collaboration in their teams

For example, electric car company Tesla uses Airtable to track inventory of vehicles leaving the factory; Time magazine uses it to monitor the production of its videos; It is used by Expedia's web development team to organize, automate and track projects, and the Mingei Museum moved 26,000 pieces of art by inventorying, tagging and tracking the packaged pieces

In countries such as the United States and Canada, Airtable is being incorporated into work processes as an indispensable tool and is now arousing interest in Europe and LATAM

**How can I use Airtable for my organization?**

You can do anything from the most classic to the most creative. Today many companies still use Excel or Google Spreadsheets to keep track of tasks, incidents, and teams. The idea behind Airtable is to be able to use a database system that is visually more "digestible" than Excel and even more flexible

The tool allows you to handle more complex processes while working in collaboration with your team

Unlike spreadsheets, Airtable is a hybrid product, because, in addition to reading numbers, cells can contain different formats for various uses: documents, dates, images, links, etc

**Uses for Airtable**

* project management system
* incident tracking platform
* editorial calendar and content planning in social networks
* planning of objectives and measurement of KPIâ€™s
* online billing manager
* custom CRM or ERP
* etc.

**Key features**

_**API and integration**_

The API offered by Airtable allows third-party applications (Gmail, Typeform, Slack, etc.) to be connected to our databases.

Ways to integrate the API with other applications:

* using Airtable's own API system and creating a custom solution, or
* connecting with an integration system like Zapier or Integromat

An example that the API gives is to connect the Typeform or Google Forms form system with your database and automate the filling of fields

Another example is being able to send a notice by email to a client every time the status of their project is updated

**Link between database tables**

Airtable offers an option to link the records of different cells and create relationships between existing tables

**Collaboration between users**

We will be able to configure our solution so that several users work simultaneously on the same database, which will allow us greater productivity in the workplace

The creator of the database can set the permission level for collaborators and define them as "creators", "editors" or "readers" Post views

In an Excel or Google Spreadsheets sheet, there is only one type of row view and if one user wants to hide or freeze columns, everyone else will be forced to see those changes

With Airtable we can create different "views" that will allow us to see the information differently (calendar, gallery, grouped elements, kanban, etc.) and adapted to each type of user or collaborator

**Forms**

This feature gives freedom for our collaborators to enter data quickly and from anywhere

The forms can be used to collect data from other people such as co-workers, clients, or external public

A Form can be easily created from an existing database and automatically arranged in the rows of the table

**Database backups**

Airtable provides a system of "snapshots" that captures the data for a period of time and allows you to go back to retrieve information. Likewise, we can also export the information of the tables to CSV files as a backup
