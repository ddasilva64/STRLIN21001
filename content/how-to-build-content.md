# How to build content



The easiest way to create content is based on what we are passionate about

* know our **buyer persona**. We can analyze on LinkedIn profiles
  * what **interests** does he have
  * what **content types** does he react
  * **group** sharing
  * **hashtags** that he follows
* **target**
  * what **content** do we want to create
  * assign a **goal** to our content (know, interact or capture data)
  * examples
    * share some useful tools that we found
    * an essential checklist that solves a problem
* **format**
  * we must choose the format, so we can **understand the resources we need** to develop and research
  * the most important thing is **to do**, but not to do perfect, that allows us to advance faster
* we must create, **the time has come**
