# Define our goal on the web

**MSIS (MEIS in Spanish) objectives**

The MSIS methodology allows us to define our purpose on LinkedIn. Consists in:

* measure
* scale-up
* impact
* socialize

**Define our MSIS goal**

We've two paths on LinkedIn, but we must choose only one:

* get the job of our dreams
* position our company

**Why only one?**

Once we select our objective, we must focus on accomplishing each task, each challenge, and each activity in order to obtain a positive result.

"Focus is a skill that can become a habit with practice and control"\
(Erick Lofholm)
