# Name, picture, and cover



* **Name**: must be _**complete**_. We mustn't place emoticons, email, or phone numbers. Also, we can add audio that indicates the pronunciation of our name
* **Picture**: it must be of good quality, _**at shoulder height**_, and _**represent professionalism**_. It must, in turn, communicate feelings (happiness, tranquility, confidence)
* **Cover**: represents _**40% of the view**_. We can communicate a sentence, a _**website**_, _**insights of our brand**_; always trying not to saturate with unnecessary information
