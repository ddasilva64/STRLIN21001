# Skills and endorsements

We add in this section our skills & endorsements. We can't ask for an endorsement from people who are not our contacts

There are:

* **top skills**. We may not select more than 3 top skills
* **industry knowledge**
* **tools & technologies**
* **interpersonal skills**
* **languages**
* **other skills**

Steps:

* **select the contact**. Before of all
* **relationship**
* **position held**
* **write a personalized message**, avoid using the default message

For the message, it's recommended:

* **greet**
* **contextualize** in time and project
* **kindly ask** for performance endorsement
* **give thank** you for their time

**We must have a 1-to-1 balance** between endorsements received and made

**We need, almost 3 endorsements** to give credibility
