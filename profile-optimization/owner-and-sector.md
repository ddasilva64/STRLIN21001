# Owner and sector



* **Headline**: we can place our current position or function. Here we will use keywords such as trade, costs, billing, sales; which will help us so that our profile appears in a specific niche. We can also place a sentence that identifies our role, for example: "I am dedicated to solving financial problems in agricultural companies"
* **Sector**: LinkedIn allows us to limit ourselves to a predetermined sector that we must choose according to our current position or function
