# A perfect LinkedIn SEO



1. Our professional headline LinkedIn scans for keywords in our professional headline\
   Use standard job titles. Avoid the wacky job titles like “Head of tea boy” and go for things that stand out and expands on your job title like...\
   “Award Winning Sports Nutritionist”
2. Claim our SEO friendly URL\
   Ok so the SEO benefits of claiming our own URL may be minimal, but it’s just good business\
   Connecting our LinkedIn profile to our name will make you to be found easier by real connections\
   It will also let you add our custom URL to business cards
3. Complete our LinkedIn profile\
   LinkedIn gives a higher level of prominence to profiles that are 100% completed. A no-brainer really!\
   Fill out every single section and use LinkedIn’s help to guide our profile to completion
4. Use anchor text in links\
   LinkedIn profiles can have up to three links, including company website and blog\
   We can actually change the anchor text to something more descriptive\
   All we've to do is select the “**Other**” option
5. Optimize our job descriptions\
   Do not keyword stuff, but do have at least one instance of our keyword that we're focusing on\
   Take an approach of optimizing around secondary keywords that are still relevant and descriptive of our skillset\
   Instead of writing out full paragraphs, use a wide variety of relevant keywords in bullet-pointed lists\
   Formatting our descriptions will also increase our profile’s scannability
6. Optimize our job titles\
   Optimizing our job titles slightly to include a few keywords is just smart\
   Instead of “Sports Therapist” bait search engines by adding something more descriptive like\
   “Elite Multi-Disciplined Sports Therapist”
7. Get more endorsements\
   Endorsements help increase the value of your profile\
   Some assume that the new LinkedIn How You Rank means that the site is moving toward popularity-based rankings, and endorsements are easily a part of that\
   It's always good to be prepared, just in case!
8. Promote our LinkedIn profile elsewhere\
   Put a link to our LinkedIn profile on our email signature, your Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts, and any websites we maintain to create inbound links to our profile
9. Make sure our profile is visible\
   It may sound obvious but make sure our profile is switched to public otherwise we will not be seen
10. Use Publisher\
    The publisher option is a new feature. It allows us to post articles directly to LinkedIn. This helps us show our expertise and gives LinkedIn bots more content and information to work with. It shows we're active, and helps our name and face show up in the news feeds of our followers
