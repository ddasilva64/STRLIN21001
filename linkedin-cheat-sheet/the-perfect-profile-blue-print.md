# The perfect profile Blue Print

To stand out on LinkedIn, we need to pay great attention to creating a professional profile

**Name**. Include your first, last, and middle name (if applicable). **This is not the place for nicknames or humorous references**

**Headline** (120 characters). This is **the most important aspect of the profile!**. We must be succinct, creative, and include **key terms that make it easy for others** to define our industry and our role within

**URL**. We must **customize** the LinkedIn URL **to make it easy** for people to find us. Find our unique URL in the light-grey box below our name. In our profile, we can click the **edit public profile & URL link** and revise

**Profile Photo**. **First impressions matter** during business meetings and when people see our profile picture. We must consider our industry in addition to potential consumers and peers to select the appropriate headshot

Adding a professional photo of ourself on our LinkedIn profile can result in 14 TIMES MORE PROFILE VIEWS!

| Get a **professional picture**. **It's worth making some investment** since we can use the images for multiple social platforms, blogs, etc.                                                                         | **Be professional**. **LinkedIn isn't Facebook**. We must structure our profile according to how would act at work                           |
| **Look personable**. We don’t have to give a goofy smile but we don’t want to appear angry either. When in doubt, **we can ask others** to give their opinions before we publish                                     | **Balance formality**. We don’t go overboard yet don’t be underdressed in our picture. We let the **photo reflect our work** attire and mood |
| **Use most of the frame**. Our face should be centered, leaving a small space over our head with the picture extending to our shoulders                                                                              | **Leave pet out**. It’s a cute sentiment, but we must **leave pets out** of our LinkedIn profile **picture**                                 |
| **Choose a familiar picture**. We must keep the photo true-to-life. If we wear glasses, we've got a beard, or often we wear a tie, we must make the profile photo representative of **how we normally look at work** | **Keep the background neutral**. **We don’t let the background distract** viewers. We must choose a neutral and non-busy background          |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                              |

**Background**

* **Summary** (2000 characters max). We write a **succinct description**, including our present and future business ambitions. We add other points of contact, including mobile number, Twitter URL, email address, etc.\
  We can add media to the summary to support credibility. Also, we can provide links to slides, videos, podcasts, blog posts, and more. **We must be precise** in describing the past and **current job**. **We must keep it positive** and highlight our skills and accomplishments\
  Adding media to our summary gives credibility to our claims about whom we say we're and what we do. Screenshots, slide shares, videos, articles that quote us, etc.
* **Experience**. Complement resume information with clips from videos, in-article quotes, slides, and other content we created that’s pertinent to our professional life\
  Try to better intrigue viewers; the longer they view your profile, the better your chances of making a business connection\
  Avoid using buzzwords and remember to show (versus tell) about our skills and talents\

  * Education/degree (100 characters)
  * Education description (1000 characters)
* **Connections** We must aspire to make (at least) 300 connections. However, limit the number of connections (to under 3,000) to keep use of the platform practical\
