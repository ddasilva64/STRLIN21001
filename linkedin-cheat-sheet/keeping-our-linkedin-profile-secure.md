# Keeping our LinkedIn profile secure



With news of so many high-profile data breaches in recent months, it’s vital to make sure we know all of the ways to keep our personal LinkedIn account information private

Automatic checks already protect all LinkedIn accounts, designed to thwart unauthorized sign-in attempts and keep users' data safe. But we can take several additional steps to ensure our account is totally protected and safe

* **Update our privacy settings**\
  In addition to the security features LinkedIn has built to protect our information, there are some additional privacy settings you can turn on or off, depending on what we want to share, display, and receive
  * Turn our activity broadcasts on or off\
    If we don't want our connections to see when we make changes to our profile, follow companies or recommend connections, uncheck this option
  * Select what others can see when we've viewed their profile\
    we can set our privacy settings to a high level, so when we view other peoples’ profiles, we're displayed to them as an “anonymous LinkedIn member”
  * Select who can see our connections\
    We can share our connections' names with our other first degree connections, or we can make our connections list visible only to we
* **Two-step verification**\
  Two-step verification requires a person to use more than one form of verification to access an account. It’s a much stronger form of account protection that can greatly reduce identity theft and unauthorized access to sensitive information since most accounts become compromised from new or unknown computers or devices\
  Here’s how to turn on two-step verification on LinkedIn
  1. We open the top-right menu and click on **Manage** next to “**Privacy & Settings**”
  2. On the tabs along the bottom-left-hand side, we click **Account/Manage security settings** (bottom of the left column)
  3. Under Two-step verification for sign-in, we click **Turn On**
  4. We enter a reliable cell phone number and then click **Send Code**
  5. **Two-step verification complete**
* **LinkedIn password & security best practices**
  1. We must **change our password every few months**
  2. We mustn’t use **the same password on all our sites or that we visit**
  3. We mustn’t use **a word from the dictionary** for our password
  4. We mustn’t use **names or slang terms** for our password
  5. We must use **lower case and upper case letters, numbers, and keyboard characters** in our password\
     A password of **8 characters length with numbers, letters & characters will take on average 2 years to crack**
  6. **Sign out of our account after we use** a publicly shared computer
  7. When it comes to creating a **password**, we must go for **length over complexity**\
     On average a hacker will be able to **“brute force” crack** a **10 character password** in **1 week** and one of **15 characters** in **150 million years**
