# How to outreach for LinkedIn recommendations



Recommendations add more credibility to our experience and work history\
For ongoing network development, a solid combination of recommendations and skill endorsements can go a long way to successful interactions. Below we have outlined the key stages to obtaining quality recommendations from our past and present customers, colleagues, and employers

| Recommendations                                                                                     | Endorsements                                                                                                                    |

| Written by other members, recommendations are ways to market our company as well as invite advocacy | Less specific, endorsements are softer signals of advocacy                                                                      |
| Seen as a high-quality trust signal from both LinkedIn and to our profile viewers                   | While still important regarding LinkedIn algorithms, endorsements are not as credible or well-sought as written recommendations |

* **Recommendations**\
  Recommendations are written by other LinkedIn members as a way to recognize or applaud a business partner or colleague. Secure some from a list of our most important and notable past colleagues and employers to add more credibility to your profile\
  Aim for between 5 and 10 recommendations\
  LinkedIn will display the two most recent recommendations received\
  Get up to two recommendations for each of our most important former positions\
  Ask for and give recommendations\
  59% of people consult friends and family for purchasing decisions More recommendations equal more business
  * **How to get more recommendations**
    1. Hover over our image in the top right corner and then select “**Privacy & Settings**”
    2. Under the “Settings” header on the “Profile” tab, select “**Manage Your Recommendations**”
    3. Select “**Ask for recommendations**”
    4. Select the past or present position that we want to be recommended for\
       Then choose up to 3 people to send recommendation requests to
    5. We create our own recommendation request versus using the autogenerated one supplied by LinkedIn as a default
    6. Be specific in what you want to be recommended for\
       We all like reading nice things about ourselves like “Pleasure to work with” but to a hiring manager, reviews of this nature adds little value to your profile
