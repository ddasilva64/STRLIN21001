# Digital guideline



In the taskbar go to the advertising icon that will direct us to the LinkedIn campaign center

In this dashboard, we can create our advertising account for each company that we own

* the standard currency is dollars
* we must link the page

After creating the account, we get to the campaign manager where we will have some defaults, and we must create a new campaign

Steps to create a campaign

* select the campaign group, that is, give it a name to identify the objective
* campaign configuration, in which we must place our buyer persona in addition to the combination of results to be clear about our budgets and scope
* we can also place the format, location, budgets, and conversion tracking
* configure the ads, where the image, copy, URL is uploaded and the conversion to be generated
* review and launch, which is where our guideline is reviewed until approved
