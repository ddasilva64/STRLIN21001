# Team strategy

We must have the **strategic focus of the mammoth**, we all want the great customer, so we must

* create **teamwork**
* **segmented** communication
* **scenario** identification

The **B2B** scenario has key players

* **takers**. They are people who influence 100% in the acquisition of the product or service, usually the CEOs or founders
* **decision makers**. They are people who influence the approval of the service/product taking, within the company they have profiles of area directors
* **influencers**. They are people who are close to the takers or decision makers, who can create a bridge of connection. Likewise, they are lower charges

**Strategy model**

* attack 2 different fronts, reach your goal, and increase sales in our brand

Commercial team of 10 people

* 5 people in group A and the other 5 in group B

Objective group A

* contact and persuade everyone who belongs to the group of influencers
* these influencers have positions such as Coordination, Account Executives, and Advisors

We are going to create specific content for that group where we solve their day-to-day problems

* tools, reflections, checklists

Once group A gains the trust of these influencers, they are allowed to recommend us to decision-makers and takers

* it is a long but alternate process that allows us to scale
* group B can be the Manager, the Directors, the Founders of our company

Target group B

* contact directly the Managers, Executives, Founders of the company we want to reach
* they are the decision-makers and the takers

When group B initiates this first contact, it will offer very different content that a manager needs to consume
