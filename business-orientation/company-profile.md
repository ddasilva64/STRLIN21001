# Company profile



To create a company page, we have the "company page" button on the top bar, in products

Can be created

* small business

* educational institution

Below is a form that asks

* organization name
* LinkedIn and web links
* sector
* size of the company
* type of company
* allows loading the logo
* slogan
* we must confirm the ownership of the company

Other aspects to configure

We can use 90% of the functions of a professional profile. Only the impact is different

To grant permissions to our team, we have the administrator tools to the right of the page dashboard

The roles are
